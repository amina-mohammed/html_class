            <h2>Ingredient</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>5 medium-sized potatoes, diced into 1-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 large brown onion, chopped</li>
                <li> 8 eggs</li>
                <li> Salt, to taste</li>
                <li> Cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li> parsley, to garnish (optional)</li>

            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a nonstick medium-sized (30cm/12-inch) pan. Fry potatoes until crispy, golden and tender. Add the onion and fry until transparent. Drain oil (use a metal colander if you have one), until all of the oil is drained.</li>
                <li>Return potatoes and onions to the pan, arranging them in a single layer. Reduce heat down to low.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs with salt and pepper to taste. Pour egg mixture into the pan, moving the potatoes and onions around the eggs using a plastic spatula. Every so often, move the eggs around the potatoes while it's cooking to ensure the eggs cook on the bottom, so there's not much eggs left on the top.</li>
            </ol>
